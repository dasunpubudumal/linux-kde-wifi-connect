# WiFi Connector for Linux KDE

This is a simple Java application designed to connect to a WiFi Network. Refer to my [blogpost](https://dasunpubudu.wordpress.com)

## Running the application.

Download [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5oYpiUn-vu8RVJlRkxKOFFkeU0/view?usp=sharing) and execute is as a ```.run``` file. i.e. either double click on it or do ```./LinuxNMConnect.run``` on a terminal.

## Using the application

* Use Display UUID button to get the details of available WiFi access points includuing the UUID.
* Use Ctrl C + Ctrl V to copy and paste the UUID into the text field.
* Please make sure you copy the UUID file properly. Otherwise it would result in an error.
* All errors will be shown and will not lead to a shutdown of the application.
* Give the correct password and press **Connect**.
* Connecting to the WiFi network may take some time. Specially if you have given wrong credentials.
* You can check the status of your network by using **Check Status** button.
